# 📸 SmartAttend – Smart Attendance System Using Facial Recognition & Location

SmartAttend is a comprehensive web application designed to automate student attendance in educational institutions using facial recognition and geolocation. It ensures secure, accurate, and transparent attendance management for students, teachers, and administrators.

## 🔍 Overview

This project solves the common problem of proxy attendance by combining **AI-powered face detection** and **GPS-based location verification**. It provides role-based dashboards for:

- **Admin** – to manage departments, courses, groups, students, and teachers.
- **Teachers** – to schedule and manage classes, control attendance, and share resources.
- **Students** – to mark attendance, access notes, and view their attendance reports.
